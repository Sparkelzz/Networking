2. OSI Model — Seven Layers Explained

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a theoretical framework used to describe how network communication happens in distinct layers. It doesn’t represent a specific technology but helps explain how data travels through a network.

🌀 The Seven Layers

> Physical Layer

Transmits raw bits over physical media (cables, wireless).

Deals with electrical/optical signals and hardware like cables, NICs, hubs.

Determines transmission mode (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex).

> Data Link Layer

Frames bits into structured frames.

Uses MAC addresses to deliver frames within the same local network.

Deals with error detection and access control (who gets to send data when).

> Network Layer

Handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing of packets across different networks.

Determines the best path for a packet from source to destination.

> Transport Layer

Ensures end-to-end delivery of data.

Breaks data into segments, manages error handling and sequencing.

Uses protocols like TCP (reliable) and UDP (fast, connectionless).

> Session Layer

Manages sessions (connections) between applications, including their start and end.

Useful for activities like logins, keeping communication states, etc.

> Presentation Layer

Translates and formats data for the application (e.g., encoding, encryption, compression).

Example protocols: TLS/SSL for secure communications.

> Application Layer

Closest to users — supports services like web browsing, email, file transfers.

Protocols include HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP.

Why it’s important: OSI helps you visualize network communication and troubleshoot problems by layer (e.g., “Is the issue at layer 3 routing or layer 2 switching?”).
