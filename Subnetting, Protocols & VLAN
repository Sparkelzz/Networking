Subnetting — Dividing Networks

Subnetting is dividing a large IP network into smaller, logical parts called subnets. This improves performance, security, and address management by limiting broadcast traffic and organizing devices logically.

🔹 How Subnets Work

Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses and subnet mask (like /24, meaning 24 bits for network + 8 bits for hosts). This way, traffic intended for one subnet doesn’t flood the others.

📉 Benefits of Subnetting

Reduces unnecessary broadcast traffic.

Improves network performance and security.

Makes address management more efficient.

🔁  Protocols – Rules for Network Communication

Protocols define how data is formatted and transmitted between devices.

✔ Common Protocols

IP (Internet Protocol) — Handles addressing and routing of packets.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) — Provides reliable, ordered data transfer.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) — Fast, connectionless transmission (no reliability).

DHCP — Assigns IP addresses automatically to devices on a network.

DNS — Converts domain names to IP addresses (like translating example.com to an IP).

ARP — Resolves an IP address to a MAC address on a local network.

These protocols work together to enable data to travel from one device to another, regardless of distance or platform.

💠  VLAN — Virtual Local Area Network

A VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a way to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks at the data link layer (OSI Layer 2). Devices in different VLANs cannot see each other’s broadcast traffic unless routed.

🚀 Why Use VLANs?

Segmentation: Groups devices by function rather than physical location.

Security: Limits traffic scope and possible unauthorized access.

Manageability: Easier to apply policies per group (e.g., voice vs. data).

VLANs use tags (according to IEEE 802.1Q) so switches know which VLAN a frame belongs to.

📊  Transport Protocols (TCP vs UDP)

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Reliable: ensures every segment arrives and is in order.
Used by web browsing, email, file transfer.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Faster, connectionless: sends data without establishing a session or checking delivery.
Used in real-time applications like streaming or DNS queries.
