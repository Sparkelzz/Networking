🧠 1. Introduction to Networking
Networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices so they can share data, services, and resources.
A network can be small (a home LAN) or global (the Internet), and is built from end devices and intermediary devices that enable communication.

🔹 Key Points

Data communication involves sending signals over physical or wireless media.

Bandwidth, throughput, latency, and jitter are performance metrics.

Network components: end devices, switches, routers, wireless access points, cabling, and services.
