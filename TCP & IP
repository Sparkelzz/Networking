🌐 TCP/IP Model — Practical Networking Framework

The TCP/IP model (also called the Internet Protocol Suite) is the real-world framework that governs how data is transmitted on the Internet. It’s simpler and more practical than OSI.

🔹 Layers of TCP/IP

> Network Access (Link) Layer

Combines OSI’s physical + data link functions.

Responsible for hardware transmission (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

> Internet Layer

Handles logical addressing, packet formation, and routing using IP.

Protocols include IP, ICMP, ARP.

> Transport Layer

Ensures data delivery services between hosts.

Uses TCP for reliable connections and UDP for fast, connectionless communication.

> Application Layer

Closest to users and applications.

Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session functions.

Protocols: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, etc.

* Why it matters: The Internet runs on TCP/IP. Understanding this stack helps you grasp real network traffic and how protocols operate end‐to‐end.

🧮  IP Addressing — Identifying Devices

An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network, similar to a postal address for mail delivery. It allows routers and other devices to locate and communicate with each other across networks.

🔹 Version Differences

IPv4 — 32-bit address (like 192.168.1.1).

IPv6 — 128-bit address (like 2001:db8::1), created because IPv4 addresses were running out.

📌 Types of IP Addresses

Public IP: Visible on the Internet.

Private IP: Used within internal networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
